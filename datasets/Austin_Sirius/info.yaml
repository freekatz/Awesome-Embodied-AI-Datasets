  introduction: Austin Sirius is a dataset developed by the University of Texas at
    Austin's RPL Lab for human-in-the-loop robot learning. It contains 570 episodes
    of a Franka Emika Panda robot performing complex household tasks like cooking
    and cleaning, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset
    supports research in human-intervention guided policy learning and real-time adaptation
    to dynamic environments. It is released under the MIT license, allowing free use
    and modification for academic and commercial purposes. Austin Sirius emphasizes
    the integration of human feedback during robot operation, making it a valuable
    resource for advancing interactive and adaptive robotics research.

short_introduction: Austin Sirius is a Franka robot dataset with 570 human-intervention
  episodes for household tasks. It includes visual and joint data, released under
  MIT. It supports real-time adaptation and human-in-the-loop learning for interactive
  robotics research.
task_description: The dataset comprises two tasks, kcup and gear. The kcup task requires
  opening the kcup holder, inserting the kcup into the holder, and closing the holder.
  The gear task requires inserting the blue gear onto the right peg, followed by inserting
  the smaller red gear.
