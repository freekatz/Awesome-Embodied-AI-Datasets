  introduction: |
    Sirius enables collaborative manipulation tasks between humans and robots through shared autonomy. 
    In this framework, robots execute actions autonomously while humans monitor performance and intervene via teleoperation to provide corrective guidance. 
    Our core algorithm leverages deployment data to iteratively refine robot policies across successive rounds of policy learning, 
    enhancing autonomy while minimizing human intervention. This closed-loop system bridges adaptive control and continuous improvement, 
    advancing human-robot teamwork in complex real-world scenarios.
    
    Key technical highlights:
    - Shared Control: Seamlessly integrates human oversight with robot autonomy.
    - Intervention-Driven Learning: Corrections via teleoperation directly inform policy updates.
    - Iterative Policy Refinement: Data from each deployment cycle optimizes future autonomy.

short_introduction: Sirius pioneers shared autonomy for human-robot collaboration, combining autonomous execution with human teleoperation for corrective interventions. Our algorithms use deployment data to iteratively refine robot policies, enabling adaptive learning across task cycles.
task_description: The dataset comprises two tasks, kcup and gear. The kcup task requires
  opening the kcup holder, inserting the kcup into the holder, and closing the holder.
  The gear task requires inserting the blue gear onto the right peg, followed by inserting
  the smaller red gear.
