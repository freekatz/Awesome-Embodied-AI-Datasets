  introduction: Austin Sailor is a dataset developed by the University of Texas at
    Austin's RPL Lab for skill-based imitation learning. It contains 5,000 episodes
    of a UR5 robot performing household tasks like stacking and sorting, including
    RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research
    in hierarchical policy learning and skill transfer, with a focus on learning from
    prior demonstrations and adapting to new tasks. While the dataset's license is
    not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. Austin Sailor
    is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons
    across different skill-based imitation learning methods.

short_introduction: Austin Sailor is a UR5 robot dataset with 5,000 episodes for household
  tasks, supporting hierarchical imitation learning. It includes visual and joint
  data. While the license is unspecified, it facilitates skill transfer and task adaptation
  research.
task_description: The robot interacts with diverse objects in a toy kitchen. It picks
  and places food items, a pan, and pot.
