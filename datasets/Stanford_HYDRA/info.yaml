introduction: Stanford HYDRA is a dataset developed by Stanford University for long-horizon
  robot manipulation tasks. It contains 570 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot
  performing complex household tasks like cooking and cleaning, including RGB images,
  depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in hierarchical
  imitation learning and multi-stage task planning, with natural language instructions
  and visual goals. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily
  intended for academic use. Stanford HYDRA is accompanied by a detailed benchmark
  and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying long-horizon manipulation
  and real-world industrial automation.
