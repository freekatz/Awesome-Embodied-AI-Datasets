# Imperial Wrist Cam


## Introduction

Imperial Wrist Cam is a dataset developed by Imperial College London for human-robot interaction research. It contains 2,000 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot performing object manipulation tasks guided by natural language instructions, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in open-vocabulary language understanding and real-time robot control, with a focus on integrating language and vision for task execution. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models for human-robot interaction tasks.
