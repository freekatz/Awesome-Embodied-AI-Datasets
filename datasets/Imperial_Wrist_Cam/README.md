# Imperial Wrist Cam


## Introduction

Robotic Platform Configuration:
The dataset is collected using a Sawyer robot equipped with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and a wrist-mounted RealSense D435 camera. The camera is positioned at a fixed offset of (7cm, 0cm, 18cm) relative to the end-effector tip coordinate system (x: forward, y: left, z: upward), with its optical axis aligned parallel to the negative z-axis for downward-facing observations.

Core Dataset Composition:
This real-world manipulation dataset focuses on wrist-camera perspectives during object interaction tasks. It provides synchronized streams of:

High-resolution RGB-D video (640Ã—480 @ 30Hz)

Proprioceptive state data (joint positions/torques)

Gripper force/tactile measurements

Precise end-effector pose annotations

Research Applications:
Designed for visuomotor policy learning, the dataset enables:

Egocentric perception modeling: Studying viewpoint invariance in manipulation

Contact-rich control: Analyzing slip detection and force modulation

Sim2real transfer: Validating policies trained in simulation

Technical Infrastructure:
Integrated with the RLDS Dataset Builder ecosystem, it offers:

Standardized data loaders (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

ROS-compatible replay tools

Automatic metadata extraction
