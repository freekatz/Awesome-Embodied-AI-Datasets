    Robotic Platform Configuration:
    The dataset is collected using a Sawyer robot equipped with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and a wrist-mounted RealSense D435 camera. The camera is positioned at a fixed offset of (7cm, 0cm, 18cm) relative to the end-effector tip coordinate system (x: forward, y: left, z: upward), with its optical axis aligned parallel to the negative z-axis for downward-facing observations.

    Core Dataset Composition:
    This real-world manipulation dataset focuses on wrist-camera perspectives during object interaction tasks. It provides synchronized streams of:

    High-resolution RGB-D video (640Ã—480 @ 30Hz)

    Proprioceptive state data (joint positions/torques)

    Gripper force/tactile measurements

    Precise end-effector pose annotations

    Research Applications:
    Designed for visuomotor policy learning, the dataset enables:

    Egocentric perception modeling: Studying viewpoint invariance in manipulation

    Contact-rich control: Analyzing slip detection and force modulation

    Sim2real transfer: Validating policies trained in simulation

    Technical Infrastructure:
    Integrated with the RLDS Dataset Builder ecosystem, it offers:

    Standardized data loaders (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

    ROS-compatible replay tools

    Automatic metadata extraction
