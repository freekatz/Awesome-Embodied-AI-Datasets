introduction: Imperial Wrist Cam is a dataset developed by Imperial College London
  for human-robot interaction research. It contains 2,000 episodes of a Franka Emika
  Panda robot performing object manipulation tasks guided by natural language instructions,
  including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research
  in open-vocabulary language understanding and real-time robot control, with a focus
  on integrating language and vision for task execution. While the dataset's license
  is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and is accompanied
  by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models for human-robot interaction tasks.
