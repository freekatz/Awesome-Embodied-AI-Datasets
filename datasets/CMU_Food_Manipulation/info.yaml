  introduction: CMU Food Manipulation is a dataset developed by Carnegie Mellon University
    for food preparation tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda
    robot interacting with food items, including RGB images, depth data, and robot
    joint states. The dataset supports research in deformable object manipulation
    and dynamic interaction, with a focus on learning from expert demonstrations.
    It is accompanied by evaluation metrics and simulation environments, making it
    suitable for studying food handling in robotics. While the dataset's license is
    not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes
    the integration of vision and proprioception for food manipulation tasks.
