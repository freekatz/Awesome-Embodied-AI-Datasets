# Tokyo PR2 Tabletop Manipulation


## Introduction

Tokyo PR2 Tabletop Manipulation is a dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for tabletop object manipulation tasks. It contains 1,500 episodes of a PR2 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. Tokyo PR2 Tabletop Manipulation is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks.
