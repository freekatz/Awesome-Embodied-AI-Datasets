  introduction: Tokyo PR2 Tabletop Manipulation is a dataset developed by the University
    of Tokyo for tabletop object manipulation tasks. It contains 1,500 episodes of
    a PR2 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data,
    and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation
    learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations.
    It is released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing free use and modification
    for academic and commercial purposes. Tokyo PR2 Tabletop Manipulation is accompanied
    by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
    vision-based robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks.
