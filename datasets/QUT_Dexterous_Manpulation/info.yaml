introduction: QUT Dexterous Manipulation is a dataset developed by Queensland University
  of Technology for dexterous object manipulation research. It contains 800 episodes
  of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with dynamic objects, including RGB images,
  depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in real-time dexterous
  generative grasp synthesis and visual servo control, with a focus on compensating
  for external disturbances. It is accompanied by evaluation metrics and simulation
  environments, making it suitable for studying dynamic object manipulation in robotics.
  While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for
  academic use and emphasizes the integration of visual and proprioceptive data.

short_description: QUT Dexterous Manipulation is a Franka robot dataset with 800 episodes
  for dynamic grasping tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports real-time
  grasp synthesis and visual servo control. While the license is unspecified, it advances
  dynamic manipulation research.
task_description: The robot performs some tasks in a tabletop setting. It sorts dishes
  and objects, cooks and serves food, sets the table, throws away trash paper, rolls
  dices, waters plants, stacks toy blocks.
