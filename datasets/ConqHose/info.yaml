introduction: ConqHose is a dataset developed by the ConqHose project for hose manipulation
  tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with hoses, including
  RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in
  open-world model-based reinforcement learning and dynamic manipulation, with a focus
  on generalization to unseen objects and environments. It is accompanied by evaluation
  scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based
  robot learning approaches for hose manipulation tasks. While the dataset's license
  is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes
  the integration of vision and proprioception for hose handling tasks.

short_description: ConqHose is a UR5 robot dataset with 1,000 episodes for hose tasks,
  including visual and joint data. It supports open-world RL and dynamic manipulation.
  While the license is unspecified, it advances hose handling research.
task_description: The robot grabs, lifts, and drags the end of a vacuum hose around
  in an office environment.
