# ConqHose


## Introduction

ConqHose is a dataset developed by the ConqHose project for hose manipulation tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with hoses, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in open-world model-based reinforcement learning and dynamic manipulation, with a focus on generalization to unseen objects and environments. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for hose manipulation tasks. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of vision and proprioception for hose handling tasks.
