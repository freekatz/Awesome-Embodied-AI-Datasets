  introduction: Furniture Bench is a dataset developed by CLVR AI for furniture assembly
    and disassembly tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with
    IKEA-like furniture, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states.
    The dataset supports research in long-horizon manipulation, task planning, and
    tool use, with a focus on real-world industrial applications. While the dataset's
    license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. Furniture
    Bench is accompanied by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, enabling
    comparisons across different robot learning approaches for complex assembly tasks.

short_introduction: Furniture Bench is a UR5 robot dataset with 1,000 furniture assembly
  episodes, supporting long-horizon manipulation. It includes visual and joint data.
  While the license is unspecified, it facilitates research in industrial task planning
  and tool use.
task_description: The robot assembles one of 9 3D-printed furniture models on the
  table, which requires grasping, inserting, and screwing.
