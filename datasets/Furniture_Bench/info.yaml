    Fundamental Challenge:
    Furniture assembly represents a critical challenge in robotic manipulation, requiring integrated capabilities in long-horizon planning, dexterous control, and robust visual perception. Existing benchmarks often lack real-world physical interactions or standardized evaluation protocols, hindering reproducible research.

    Benchmark Design:
    FurnitureBench addresses this gap as a real-world robotic assembly benchmark, featuring:

    Diverse Tasks: Five IKEA furniture items (e.g., square table, cabinet) with varying complexity, each requiring 30-60 assembly steps.

    Rich Dataset: Over 550 hours of human teleoperation data, including RGB-D observations, proprioceptive states, and action trajectories.

    Standardized Metrics: Success rates, task completion time, and smoothness of motion, with a focus on generalization across object categories and hardware configurations.

    Key Findings:
    Evaluation of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., RL, imitation learning) reveals significant performance gaps:

    Imitation Learning: Achieves only 42% success rate due to error compounding in long sequences.

    Reinforcement Learning: Struggles with sparse rewards, requiring >10k episodes for basic proficiency.

    Hardware Variance: Policies trained on one robot show >60% performance drop when transferred to other platforms (e.g., Franka vs. UR5).

    Community Impact:
    The benchmark provides open-source resources:

    Task definitions with furniture CAD models and assembly manuals

    Simulation-to-real calibration tools

    Pre-trained baseline models and leaderboards
    This enables reproducible research toward automating daily activities like home assembly.

short_introduction: FurnitureBench is a real-world robotic benchmark for long-horizon furniture assembly, featuring 5+ IKEA items and 550+ hours of human data. It exposes critical limitations in current methods (e.g., â‰¤42% success for imitation learning) and provides standardized metrics/sim2real tools to accelerate manipulation research.
