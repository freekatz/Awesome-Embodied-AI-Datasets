# Furniture Bench


## Introduction

Furniture Bench is a dataset developed by CLVR AI for furniture assembly and disassembly tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with IKEA-like furniture, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in long-horizon manipulation, task planning, and tool use, with a focus on real-world industrial applications. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. Furniture Bench is accompanied by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, enabling comparisons across different robot learning approaches for complex assembly tasks.

## Task Description

The robot assembles one of 9 3D-printed furniture models on the table, which requires grasping, inserting, and screwing.
