# KAIST Nonprehensile Objects


## Introduction

KAIST Nonprehensile Objects is a robotics dataset developed by KAIST for nonprehensile object manipulation research. It contains 1,000 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with nonprehensile objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in open-world model-based reinforcement learning and dynamic manipulation, with a focus on generalization to unseen objects and environments. It is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. KAIST Nonprehensile Objects is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for nonprehensile tasks.

## Task Description

The robot performs various non-prehensile manipulation tasks in a tabletop environment. It translates and reorients diverse real-world and 3d-printed objects to a target 6dof pose.
