# ALOHA


## Introduction

ALOHA is a Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation. With a $20k budget, it is capable of teleoperating precise tasks such as threading a zip tie, dynamic tasks such as juggling a ping pong ball, and contact-rich tasks such as assembling the chain in the NIST board 2.
