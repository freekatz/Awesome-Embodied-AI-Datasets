  introduction: USC Jaco Play is a dataset developed by the CLVR Lab at USC, focusing
    on teleoperated manipulation tasks with a Jaco 2 robot. It contains 1,085 episodes
    of pick-and-place tasks in simulated environments, including RGB images, joint
    positions, and Cartesian coordinates. The dataset includes natural language instructions
    and object states, supporting research in language-conditioned robot learning
    and vision-based control. It is released under the Creative Commons Attribution
    4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, requiring attribution to the original authors.
    The dataset is structured for easy integration with existing robotics frameworks,
    making it a valuable resource for training models to generalize across tasks and
    environments.

short_introduction: USC Jaco Play is a CLVR Lab dataset with 1,085 teleoperated Jaco
  2 episodes. It includes language instructions and visual data for pick-and-place
  tasks, released under CC BY 4.0. It supports language-conditioned models and vision-based
  control, facilitating task generalization research.
task_description: The robot performs pick-place tasks in a tabletop toy kitchen environment.
  Some examples of the task include, "Pick up the orange fruit.", "Put the black bowl
  in the sink."
