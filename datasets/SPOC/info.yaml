    SPoC (Search-based Pseudocode to Code) is a novel dataset and framework for translating human-written pseudocode into executable programs through compiler-guided search. Curated by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Google Research, it contains 18,356 C++ programs paired with pseudocode descriptions and test cases. Key innovations include:

    Error-Driven Credit Assignment:

    Leverages compiler errors (covering 88.7% of program failures) to locate faulty code segments and prioritize alternative translations for specific pseudocode lines, enabling targeted search refinement .

    Discretized Translation Units:

    Treats each pseudocode line as an independent translation unit, allowing localized error correction without reprocessing the entire program .

    Test-Case Validation:

    Uses test cases to verify functional correctness of synthesized programs, ensuring semantic alignment with pseudocode intent .

    Under a search budget of 100 programs, SPoC increases synthesis success rates from 25.6% (top-one translation) to 44.7% while reducing redundant exploration by 60% .
