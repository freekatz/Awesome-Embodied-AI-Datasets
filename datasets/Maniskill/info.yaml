  introduction: ManiSkill2 is a unified benchmark for learning generalizable robotic manipulation skills, powered by SAPIEN, designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks, such as the lack of object-level topological and geometric variations, fully dynamic simulation, and native support for multiple manipulation tasks. ManiSkill2 includes 20 manipulation task families, over 2000 object models, and more than 4 million demonstration frames, covering stationary/mobile-base, single/dual-arm, and rigid/soft-body manipulation tasks with 2D/3D input data simulated by fully dynamic engines. The benchmark supports a wide range of algorithms, including classic sense-plan-act, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, etc., and supports various visual observations (point cloud, RGBD) and controllers (e.g., action type and parameterization). ManiSkill2 also empowers fast visual input learning, allowing a CNN-based policy to collect samples at about 2000 FPS with 1 GPU and 16 processes on a regular workstation. The codes for the simulator, environments, and baselines are open-source, and an online challenge is hosted for interdisciplinary researchers.

short_introduction: ManiSkill2 is a unified benchmark powered by SAPIEN for learning generalizable robotic manipulation skills, featuring 20 task families, 2000+ object models, and 4M+ demonstration frames, supporting fast visual learning algorithms and various algorithm types.
task_description: The robot interacts with different objects placed on the plane (ground).
  The tasks include picking an isolated object or an object from the clutter up and
  moving it to a goal position, stacking a red cube onto a green cube, inserting a
  peg into the box, assembling kits, plugging a charger into the outlet on the wall,
  turning on a faucet.
