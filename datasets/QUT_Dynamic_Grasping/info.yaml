  introduction: |
    Dynamic Grasping Dataset is a specialized robotic manipulation dataset designed to advance research in real-time object grasping under motion. It contains 812 successful trajectories collected using a Franka Panda robotic arm interacting with objects on a programmable XY motion platform. Key features include:

    Dynamic Object Movement: Objects are transported at variable speeds (0.1–0.5 m/s) along randomized trajectories via a CoreXY motion platform (3D-printable design with open-source components), simulating real-world scenarios like conveyor belts or moving targets.

    Multi-modal Sensing: Each trajectory provides synchronized RGB-D video (640×480 @30Hz), joint states, end-effector poses, and binary grasp success labels, stored in RLDS-compatible format to preserve temporal integrity of step sequences.

    Task Diversity: Covers 15 object categories (e.g., cubes, cylinders, irregular shapes) with varying textures and masses, requiring adaptive grasp strategies to compensate for object acceleration and slip.

    This dataset serves as a benchmark for testing robust visuomotor policies in dynamic environments, enabling reproducible evaluation of offline RL and imitation learning algorithms.
