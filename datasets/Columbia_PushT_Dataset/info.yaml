  introduction: The Diffusion Policy dataset is a comprehensive collection of robotic manipulation trajectories designed to advance visuomotor policy learning via conditional denoising diffusion models, supporting training and evaluation across 15 diverse tasks from four real-world benchmarks including the Push-T task where a robot must precisely push a T-shaped block into a target zone while navigating the end-effector to a termination area, exemplifying the dataset’s focus on high-precision manipulation under multimodal action distributions and dynamic environmental constraints; its core technical contributions include an action diffusion formulation that reformulates robot actions as a denoising process to iteratively refine noise into optimal actions via stochastic Langevin dynamics for handling multimodal action spaces and high-dimensional sequences, closed-loop action sequences enabling training of policies to predict temporally consistent action sequences (e.g., 10-timestep pushing trajectories) with receding horizon control for balancing long-horizon planning and real-time reactivity in tasks like Push-T requiring mid-execution corrections for object slippage, efficient visual conditioning processing visual observations (e.g., T-block camera feeds) once per inference as conditional inputs to reduce compute latency by >40% for real-time 10 Hz control on physical robots, and architecture flexibility supporting CNN-based (low-frequency tasks) and Transformer-based (high-frequency velocity control) diffusion backbones across tasks from rigid object insertion to deformable fabric manipulation, with performance highlights including a 46.9% average improvement over prior methods (implicit policies, behavior cloning) across 15 tasks, 93% success rate on Push-T under visual occlusion and variable friction forces, and 3× faster convergence than RL baselines using only 200 demonstrations per task.

short_introduction: The Diffusion Policy dataset enables training of diffusion-based visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation. It covers 15 tasks, including precision Push-T operations, and supports action generation via iterative denoising. Policies trained on this dataset achieve 46.9% higher success rates with real-time inference capabilities.
task_description: The robot pushes a T-shaped block into a fixed goal pose, and then
  move to an fixed exit zone.
