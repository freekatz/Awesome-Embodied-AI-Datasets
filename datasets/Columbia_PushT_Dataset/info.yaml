  introduction: Columbia PushT Dataset is a robotics dataset developed by Columbia
    University for vision-based manipulation tasks. It contains 1,647 real-world trajectories
    of a UR5 robot pushing T-shaped blocks into target positions, with RGB images,
    depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset is designed to support research
    in diffusion-based policy learning, particularly for long-horizon tasks requiring
    precise control. It is released under the MIT license, allowing free use and modification
    for academic and commercial purposes. Columbia PushT Dataset is accompanied by
    evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, making it a valuable resource for studying
    visuomotor policy learning and dynamic adaptation in physical robots.

short_introduction: Columbia PushT Dataset is a UR5 robot dataset with 1,647 pushing
  trajectories, supporting diffusion-based policy learning. It includes visual and
  joint data, released under MIT. It advances long-horizon manipulation and dynamic
  control research.
task_description: The robot pushes a T-shaped block into a fixed goal pose, and then
  move to an fixed exit zone.
