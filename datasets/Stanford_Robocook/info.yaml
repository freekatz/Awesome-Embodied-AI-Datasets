  introduction: Stanford Robocook is a dataset developed by Stanford University for
    cooking and meal preparation tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a Sawyer robot
    performing complex cooking tasks like chopping, mixing, and serving, including
    RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research
    in hierarchical imitation learning and multi-stage task planning, with natural
    language instructions and visual goals. It is accompanied by a detailed benchmark
    and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying long-horizon manipulation
    and real-world industrial automation. While the dataset's license is not explicitly
    stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration
    of language and vision for task execution.

short_introduction: Stanford Robocook is a Sawyer robot dataset with 1,000 episodes
  for cooking tasks, including visual and language data. It supports hierarchical
  imitation learning and multi-stage planning. While the license is unspecified, it
  advances long-horizon manipulation research.
task_description: In the first task, the robot pinches the dough with an asymmetric
  gripper / two-rod symmetric gripper / two-plane symmetric gripper. In the second
  task, the robot presses the dough with a circle press / square press / circle punch
  / square punch. In the third task, the robot rolls the dough with a large roller
  / small roller.
