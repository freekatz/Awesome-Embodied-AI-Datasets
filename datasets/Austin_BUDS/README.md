# Austin BUDS


## Introduction

Austin BUDS is a dataset developed by the University of Texas at Austin for bottom-up skill discovery in robot manipulation. It contains 365 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in unsupervised skill discovery and hierarchical policy learning, with a focus on learning reusable skills from unsegmented demonstrations. It is released under the MIT license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. Austin BUDS is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different skill discovery and policy learning approaches.

## Task Description

The robot is trying to solve a long-horizon kitchen task by picking up pot, placing the pot in a plate, and push them together using a picked-up tool.
