introduction: Austin BUDS is a dataset developed by the University of Texas at Austin
  for bottom-up skill discovery in robot manipulation. It contains 365 episodes of
  a UR5 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data,
  and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in unsupervised skill discovery
  and hierarchical policy learning, with a focus on learning reusable skills from
  unsegmented demonstrations. It is released under the MIT license, allowing free
  use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. Austin BUDS is accompanied
  by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
  skill discovery and policy learning approaches.

short_description: Austin BUDS is a UR5 robot dataset with 365 episodes for skill
  discovery, supporting unsupervised hierarchical learning. It includes visual and
  joint data, released under MIT. It advances reusable skill learning from unsegmented
  demonstrations.
task_description: The robot is trying to solve a long-horizon kitchen task by picking
  up pot, placing the pot in a plate, and push them together using a picked-up tool.
