  introduction: RT-1 Robot Action is a robotics dataset developed by Google Research,
    designed to enable robots to learn from diverse experiences across different tasks
    and environments. The dataset contains over 130,000 episodes of real-world robot
    actions collected from a fleet of robots over 17 months, covering more than 700
    tasks such as grasping, pushing, and object repositioning. It emphasizes scalability
    and generalization by combining data from various robots, allowing models to learn
    transferable skills. The dataset is structured with RGB camera feeds, natural
    language instructions, and motor commands, supporting end-to-end control using
    the Robotics Transformer (RT-1) architecture. It is released under the permissive
    Apache 2.0 license, encouraging both academic and commercial use while promoting
    collaboration in the robotics community. RT-1 has demonstrated significant improvements
    in generalization to new tasks and environments, making it a valuable resource
    for advancing scalable robot learning research.
