  introduction: |
    PLEX is a groundbreaking integration framework developed by Microsoft, enabling native execution of Python code within Excel spreadsheets. By simply entering =PY in a cell, users can directly leverage Python's data analysis, machine learning, and visualization libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib) without local environment setup. Powered by cloud-based computation, PLEX executes code on Azure servers and returns results to Excel, combining Excel's accessibility with Python's scalability. Key innovations include:

    Seamless interoperability: Excel ranges convert to pandas DataFrames for Python processing, with outputs (tables/plots) rendered back as Excel-native objects.

    Anaconda ecosystem support: Pre-installed libraries (e.g., Seaborn, statsmodels) allow complex workflows like weather forecasting ML models directly in spreadsheets.

    Collaboration-friendly: Workbooks with Python code retain full functionality in Microsoft 365's co-editing mode, enabling team-based data science.
