introduction: Plex RoboSuite is a dataset developed by Microsoft for robot learning
  in simulated environments. It contains over 10 million episodes of simulated robot-object
  interaction across 113 unique camera viewpoints, including RGB images, depth data,
  and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in reinforcement learning,
  imitation learning, and cross-domain generalization, with a focus on learning from
  diverse and unstructured data. It is accompanied by a detailed simulation environment
  and evaluation framework, making it a valuable resource for advancing robot learning
  in complex, dynamic environments. While the dataset's license is not explicitly
  stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration
  of simulation and real-world data for robot learning.
