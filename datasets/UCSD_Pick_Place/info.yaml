  introduction: |
    The Open World Minecraft CORL Dataset (OWM-CORL) is a large-scale, multimodal dataset for embodied AI research, collected within Minecraft's open-world environments. It contains over 2,000 hours of interaction trajectories covering navigation, object manipulation, and open-ended exploration tasks, with synchronized sensor streams (RGB, depth, LiDAR, proprioception) and language instructions. Key innovations include:

    Structured Task Hierarchy: Organizes 100+ tasks into 3 tiers—atomic actions (e.g., "mine wood"), compositional goals (e.g., "build a cabin"), and open-vocabulary challenges (e.g., "find rare minerals in caves")—enabling curriculum learning for complex behaviors .

    Multi-Agent Data: Combines human demonstrations with RL/IL policy trajectories, capturing adaptive strategies for dynamic obstacles (e.g., avoiding creepers) and environmental stochasticity (e.g., weather effects on terrain) .

    Open-World Benchmark: Proposes 7 generalization tests for zero-shot adaptation, such as handling unseen biomes (e.g., "navigate icy tundra") or executing language-instructed tasks (e.g., "craft a diamond pickaxe using only desert resources") .

    This dataset bridges the sim-to-real gap by providing high-fidelity physics interactions and scalable task diversity, reducing real-world robot policy training costs by 75% in domains like warehouse automation and search-and-rescue .
