# UCSD Kitchen


## Introduction

UCSD Kitchen is a robotics dataset developed by UC San Diego, focusing on household manipulation tasks in a simulated kitchen environment. The dataset contains 150 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with kitchen objects, including RGB images, joint states, and natural language instructions. It supports research in vision-based imitation learning and language-conditioned control, with a focus on long-horizon tasks like meal preparation and cleanup. The dataset is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. UCSD Kitchen is structured to facilitate the training of models that can generalize across different kitchen tasks and object configurations, making it a valuable resource for advancing household robotics research.
