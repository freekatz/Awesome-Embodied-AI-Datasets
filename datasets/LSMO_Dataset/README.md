## Introduction

This study explores how participation in social activities protects cognitive health in older adults. Participation is defined as the combination of various activities aimed at fulfilling social roles, including family interactions, use of public transport, and academic training. Research indicates that higher participation is associated with higher levels of global cognition and lower rates of cognitive decline, while low participation predicts cognitive decline and dementia. Additionally, depression is linked to cognitive decline and its progression to dementia, and longitudinal studies show that depression is a risk factor for reduced participation levels, potentially leading to a higher risk of cognitive decline. Participation tends to decrease after the age of 75.

To measure participation, this study uses the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective (PART-O) tool, which includes 24 items assessing productivity, social integration, and community participation. Bogner et al. (2011) proposed a transformed scoring system, grouping 17 items into subscales such as productivity, social relations, and being out and about, to improve homogeneity and balance. Although PART-O is widely used in patients with traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury and has good psychometric properties, its application in older adults is less common.

The aim of this study is to validate the transformed scoring system proposed by Bogner et al. (2011) against the direct scoring system in older adults and to analyze the relationship between participation and cognitive functions, as well as the influence of age and mood on participation and cognitive functions, using structural equation modeling. The results show that the transformed scoring model has stronger correlations with cognitive functions, participation is a direct predictor of cognitive functions, and age and depression inversely affect participation.
