# LSMO Dataset


## Introduction

LSMO Dataset is a robotics dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for long-term sequential manipulation tasks. It contains 570 episodes of a PR2 robot performing complex household tasks like cooking and cleaning, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in hierarchical imitation learning and multi-stage task planning, with natural language instructions and visual goals. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. LSMO Dataset is accompanied by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying long-horizon manipulation and real-world industrial automation.
