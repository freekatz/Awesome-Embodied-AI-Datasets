introduction: LSMO Dataset is a robotics dataset developed by the University of Tokyo
  for long-term sequential manipulation tasks. It contains 570 episodes of a PR2 robot
  performing complex household tasks like cooking and cleaning, including RGB images,
  depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in hierarchical
  imitation learning and multi-stage task planning, with natural language instructions
  and visual goals. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily
  intended for academic use. LSMO Dataset is accompanied by a detailed benchmark and
  evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying long-horizon manipulation
  and real-world industrial automation.
