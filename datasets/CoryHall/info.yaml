introduction: CoryHall is a dataset developed by the University of California, Berkeley,
  for real-world robot navigation tasks. It contains 570 episodes of a PR2 robot navigating
  complex indoor environments, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states.
  The dataset supports research in hierarchical imitation learning and multi-stage
  task planning, with natural language instructions and visual goals. It is accompanied
  by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying
  long-horizon manipulation and real-world industrial automation. While the dataset's
  license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and
  emphasizes the integration of language and vision for task execution.
