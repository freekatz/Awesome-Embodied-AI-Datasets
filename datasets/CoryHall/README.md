# CoryHall


## Introduction

CoryHall is a dataset developed by the University of California, Berkeley, for real-world robot navigation tasks. It contains 570 episodes of a PR2 robot navigating complex indoor environments, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in hierarchical imitation learning and multi-stage task planning, with natural language instructions and visual goals. It is accompanied by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying long-horizon manipulation and real-world industrial automation. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of language and vision for task execution.
