introduction: SACSoN is a dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for shared
  autonomy and collaboration research. It contains 1,500 episodes of a PR2 robot performing
  complex household tasks like cooking and cleaning, including RGB images, depth data,
  and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in human-intervention guided
  policy learning and real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. It is accompanied
  by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
  vision-based robot learning approaches for complex manipulation tasks. While the
  dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic
  use and emphasizes the integration of human feedback during robot operation.

short_description: SACSoN is a PR2 robot dataset with 1,500 episodes for household
  tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports human-intervention learning
  and real-time adaptation. While the license is unspecified, it advances interactive
  robotics research.
task_description: Mobile robot navigates pedestrian-rich environments (e.g. offices,
  school buildings etc.) and runs a learned policy that may interact with the pedestrians.
