  introduction:In the field of robotic manipulation, achieving efficient training and good policy transferability 
  has always been a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose the "Hierarchical Modularity" approach. 
  This method decomposes complex tasks into reusable sub-modules and uses the "Supervised Attention" mechanism to 
  dynamically combine these sub-modules to meet different task requirements. At the same time, we have constructed
  an automated 3D object synthesis process and adopted a curriculum learning strategy to accelerate the model
  training process. Experiments show that compared with traditional methods, such as BC-Z, our method increases the 
  training speed by 30%-50% and improves the success rate of cross-robot task execution by 25%. We have conducted
  numerous experiments in simulated environments (such as Franka, UR5) and on real UR5 robots, covering tasks such as 
  obstacle avoidance and object relational placement, fully verifying the efficiency and generalization ability of 
  this method. In addition, this method can also introspect the robot's decision-making process at runtime, improving 
  the interpretability of the model and helping to further optimize the robot policy.

short_introduction: We introduce "Hierarchical Modularity" for robotic manipulation, breaking tasks into reusable
  sub-modules and using "Supervised Attention" for dynamic combination. With an automated 3D object pipeline and
  curriculum learning, it speeds up training by 30 - 50% and boosts cross-robot success by 25%. Validated in 
  simulations and on real robots, it also enables runtime introspection for interpretability.
task_description: The robot interacts with a few objects on a table. It picks up,
  pushes forward, or rotates the objects.
