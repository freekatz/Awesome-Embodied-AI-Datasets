introduction: ASU TableTop Manipulation is a robotics dataset developed by Arizona
  State University for tabletop object manipulation tasks. It contains 1,500 episodes
  of a UR5 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data,
  and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation
  learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations.
  It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons
  across different vision-based robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks. While
  the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic
  use and emphasizes generalization to novel object configurations.

task_description: The robot interacts with a few objects on a table. It picks up,
  pushes forward, or rotates the objects.
