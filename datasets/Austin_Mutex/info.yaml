  introduction: Austin Mutex is a dataset developed by the University of Texas at
    Austin's RPL Lab for multimodal task specification learning. It contains 5,000
    episodes of a UR5 robot performing household tasks like stacking and sorting,
    including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports
    research in hierarchical policy learning and skill transfer, with a focus on learning
    from prior demonstrations and adapting to new tasks. It is released under the
    MIT license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes.
    Austin Mutex is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling
    comparisons across different skill-based imitation learning methods.

short_introduction: Austin Mutex is a UR5 robot dataset with 5,000 episodes for household
  tasks, supporting hierarchical imitation learning. It includes visual and joint
  data, released under MIT. It facilitates skill transfer and task adaptation research.
task_description: The Mutex dataset involves a diverse range of tasks in a home environment,
  encompassing pick and place tasks like "putting bread on a plate," as well as contact-rich
  tasks such as "opening an air fryer and putting a bowl with dogs in it" or "taking
  out a tray from the oven and placing bread on it."
