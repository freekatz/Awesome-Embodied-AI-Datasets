# Austin Mutex


## Introduction

The MUTEX (Multi-Object Tracking Under Exocentric View) dataset is a specialized benchmark for multi-object tracking in exocentric perspectives, such as aerial views from drones or elevated cameras. Developed by the Robot Perception Lab at UT Austin, it features diverse real-world scenarios with complex object interactions, occlusions, and environmental challenges. The dataset provides high-precision bounding box annotations and trajectory IDs across varied lighting/weather conditions, specifically designed to advance research in occlusion handling and viewpoint-invariant tracking algorithms. Licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, it supports non-commercial academic use with mandatory attribution.

## Task Description

The Mutex dataset involves a diverse range of tasks in a home environment, encompassing pick and place tasks like "putting bread on a plate," as well as contact-rich tasks such as "opening an air fryer and putting a bowl with dogs in it" or "taking out a tray from the oven and placing bread on it."
