  introduction: TidyBot is a dataset developed by Princeton University for household
    cleaning tasks. It contains 570 episodes of a PR2 robot performing cleaning tasks
    like sweeping and mopping, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states.
    The dataset supports research in hierarchical imitation learning and multi-stage
    task planning, with natural language instructions and visual goals. It is accompanied
    by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying
    long-horizon manipulation and real-world industrial automation. While the dataset's
    license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and
    emphasizes the integration of language and vision for task execution.
