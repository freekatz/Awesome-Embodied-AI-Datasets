  introduction: Berkeley RPT Data is a robotics dataset developed by the University
    of California, Berkeley, for real-world manipulation tasks. It contains 1,000
    episodes of a xArm robot performing complex household tasks like cooking and cleaning,
    including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports
    research in hierarchical imitation learning and multi-stage task planning, with
    natural language instructions and visual goals. It is released under the Creative
    Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and
    modification for academic and commercial purposes. Berkeley RPT Data is accompanied
    by a detailed benchmark and evaluation framework, making it suitable for studying
    long-horizon manipulation and real-world industrial automation.
