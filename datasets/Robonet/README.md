# Robonet


## Introduction

Robonet is a large-scale robotics dataset developed by researchers at Stanford University and Google, focusing on multi-robot learning and manipulation tasks. It contains over 15 million video frames of robot-object interaction across 113 unique camera viewpoints, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and cross-domain generalization, with a focus on learning from diverse and unstructured data. It is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. Robonet is accompanied by a detailed simulation environment and evaluation framework, making it a valuable resource for advancing robot learning in complex, dynamic environments.
