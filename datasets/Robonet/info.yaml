  introduction: Robonet is a large-scale robotics dataset developed by researchers
    at Stanford University and Google, focusing on multi-robot learning and manipulation
    tasks. It contains over 15 million video frames of robot-object interaction across
    113 unique camera viewpoints, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint
    states. The dataset supports research in reinforcement learning, imitation learning,
    and cross-domain generalization, with a focus on learning from diverse and unstructured
    data. It is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
    (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial
    purposes. Robonet is accompanied by a detailed simulation environment and evaluation
    framework, making it a valuable resource for advancing robot learning in complex,
    dynamic environments.
