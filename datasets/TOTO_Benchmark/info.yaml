  introduction: TOTO Benchmark is a robotics dataset developed for the Train Offline,
    Test Online (TOTO) competition at NeurIPS 2023, focusing on real-world robot learning
    tasks. The dataset includes over 100 human-teleoperated trajectories of pouring
    and scooping tasks collected from a Franka Emika Panda robot, with RGB images,
    natural language instructions, and robot joint states. It emphasizes the challenge
    of training models offline using expert demonstrations and evaluating them online
    on physical robots, requiring generalization to unseen scenarios. The dataset
    is released under the Apache 2.0 license, enabling both academic and commercial
    use while promoting reproducibility in robotics research. TOTO Benchmark serves
    as a critical resource for advancing offline RL and behavior cloning methods in
    real-world manipulation tasks.

short_introduction: TOTO Benchmark is a NeurIPS 2023 competition dataset for real-world
  robot learning, containing over 100 human-teleoperated pouring and scooping trajectories.
  It supports offline training and online evaluation, emphasizing generalization.
  Released under Apache 2.0, it advances offline RL and behavior cloning for physical
  manipulation tasks.
task_description: 'The TOTO Benchmark Dataset contains trajectories of two tasks:
  scooping and pouring. For scooping, the objective is to scoop material from a bowl
  into the spoon. For pouring, the goal is to pour some material into a target cup
  on the table.'
