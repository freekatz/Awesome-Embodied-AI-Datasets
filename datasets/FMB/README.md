# FMB


## Introduction

FMB (Functional Manipulation Benchmark) is a dataset developed by the Functional Manipulation Benchmark project for object functional manipulation tasks. It contains 1,500 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for functional manipulation tasks. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of vision and proprioception for object function understanding.
