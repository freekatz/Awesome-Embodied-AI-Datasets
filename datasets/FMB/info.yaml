  introduction: FMB (Functional Manipulation Benchmark) is a dataset developed by
    the Functional Manipulation Benchmark project for object functional manipulation
    tasks. It contains 1,500 episodes of a UR5 robot interacting with household objects,
    including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports
    research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with
    a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is accompanied by evaluation
    scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based
    robot learning approaches for functional manipulation tasks. While the dataset's
    license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and
    emphasizes the integration of vision and proprioception for object function understanding.
