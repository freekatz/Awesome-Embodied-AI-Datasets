  introduction: CMU Franka Pick-Insert Data is a dataset developed by Carnegie Mellon
    University for pick-and-place and insertion tasks. It contains 500 episodes of
    a Franka Emika Panda robot manipulating objects in cluttered environments, including
    RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research
    in open-world model-based reinforcement learning and dynamic manipulation, with
    a focus on generalization to unseen objects and environments. It is accompanied
    by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
    vision-based robot learning approaches for pick-and-place tasks. While the dataset's
    license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and
    emphasizes the integration of vision and proprioception.

short_introduction: CMU Franka Pick-Insert Data is a Franka robot dataset with 500
  episodes for pick-and-place tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports
  open-world RL and dynamic manipulation. While the license is unspecified, it emphasizes
  generalization to unseen objects for academic research.
task_description: The robot tries to pick up different shaped objects placed in front
  of it. It also tries to insert particular objects into a cylindrical peg.
