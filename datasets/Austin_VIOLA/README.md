# Austin VIOLA


## Introduction

VIOLA is an innovative object - centric imitation learning approach designed to learn closed - loop visuomotor strategies for robotic manipulation. This method builds object - centric representations based on general object proposals from pre - trained visual models. It employs a Transformer - based policy to reason about these representations and focuses on task - relevant visual factors for manipulation prediction. This object - based structural prior significantly enhances the robustness of deep imitation learning algorithms against object variations and environmental disturbances. Quantitatively evaluated on both simulated and real robots, VIOLA achieves a success rate 45.8% higher than the state - of - the - art imitation learning methods. It has also been successfully deployed on physical robots to tackle challenging long - horizon tasks, such as table setting and coffee making.
