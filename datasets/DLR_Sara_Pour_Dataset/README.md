# DLR Sara Pour Dataset


## Introduction

The DLR Sara Pour Dataset (hosted on TensorFlow Datasets) offers real-world robotic pouring trajectories to advance safe reinforcement learning, capturing 65 episodes (âˆ¼16 minutes) of autonomous pouring on a physical robot with multimodal sensor streams (RGB-D images, proprioceptive states, torque measurements), safety-critical annotations (real-time constraint violations like spill thresholds and tilt limits), and sparse reward signals (task-completion indicators for policy optimization); concurrently, the research "Real-World Robot Learning with Safety Constraints" demonstrates using this dataset to train constraint-aware policies that achieve zero safety violations during pouring despite sparse rewards, learn directly on physical robots in <17 minutes without simulation, and maintain 85% success with unseen container geometries via real-time torque monitoring to prevent spills and geometric path certificates for collision-free motions, pioneering simulation-free RL for liquid manipulation validated in industrial-relevant scenarios.

## Task Description

The robot learns to pour ping-pong balls from a cup held in the end-effector into the cup placed on the table.
