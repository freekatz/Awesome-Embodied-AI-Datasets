introduction: DLR Sara Pour Dataset is a robotics dataset developed by the German
  Aerospace Center (DLR) for pouring and fluid manipulation tasks. It contains 1,000
  episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with liquid containers, including
  RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in
  real-time adaptation and human-in-the-loop learning, with a focus on integrating
  human feedback during robot operation. While the dataset's license is not explicitly
  stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. DLR Sara Pour Dataset is accompanied
  by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
  pouring and fluid manipulation approaches.

short_description: DLR Sara Pour Dataset is a DLR dataset with Franka robot episodes
  for pouring tasks, including visual and joint data. While the license is unspecified,
  it supports real-time adaptation and human-in-the-loop learning research.
task_description: The robot learns to pour ping-pong balls from a cup held in the
  end-effector into the cup placed on the table.
