  introduction: The Mobile ALOHA dataset is a resource for robotic mobile manipulation tasks, collected through a low-cost, whole-body teleoperation system. It extends the ALOHA system by incorporating a mobile base and a whole-body teleoperation interface. The dataset includes approximately 50 demonstrations per task, and co-training with static ALOHA datasets can increase task success rates by up to 90%. This enables robots to autonomously complete complex tasks such as saut√©ing and serving shrimp, opening a two-door wall cabinet, calling and entering an elevator, and rinsing a pan using a kitchen faucet.

short_introduction: The Mobile ALOHA dataset supports robotic mobile manipulation tasks like cooking and elevator use through low-cost teleoperation, significantly improving success rates.
task_description: The robot interacts with diverse appliances in a real kitchen and
  indoor environments. It wipes spilled wine, stores a heavy pot to be inside wall
  cabinets, calls an elevator, pushes chairs, and cooks shrimp.
