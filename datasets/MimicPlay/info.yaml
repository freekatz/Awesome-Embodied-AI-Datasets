action_space: Operational space control (OSC), which is similar to Task space position
  control but OSC is impedance control with consideration of the mass matrix. OSC
  is also used by VIOLA.

  introduction: |
    The MimicPlay dataset is designed to support research in long-horizon robotic manipulation through imitation learning. It comprises two primary components: human play data, consisting of video sequences of individuals freely interacting with their environment using their hands, used to train a goal-conditioned trajectory generation model for creating a latent plan space; and teleoperated robot demonstration data, typically around 20 demonstrations per task, used to train a low-level robot controller conditioned on latent plans. The dataset supports 14 long-horizon manipulation tasks, facilitating the development of efficient imitation learning algorithms with superior performance, robustness, and generalization to new tasks compared to existing methods.

short_introduction: The MimicPlay dataset combines human play videos and limited robot demonstrations to support imitation learning for 14 long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating efficiency and generalization.
task_description: The robot interacts with various appliances in five different scenes,
  including a kitchen with an oven; a study desk with a bookshelf and lamp; flowers
  and a vase; toy sandwich making; and cloth folding. It opens the microwave and drawers;
  places a book on the shelf; inserts a flower into the vase; and assembles a sandwich.
