  control but OSC is impedance control with consideration of the mass matrix. OSC

introduction: MimicPlay is a dataset developed by the MimicPlay project for human-robot
  imitation learning. It contains 2,000 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot performing
  object manipulation tasks guided by natural language instructions, including RGB
  images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in open-vocabulary
  language understanding and real-time robot control, with a focus on integrating
  language and vision for task execution. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts
  and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different human-robot interaction
  methods. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended
  for academic use and emphasizes the integration of visual and language data for
  robot task understanding.

short_description: MimicPlay is a Franka robot dataset with 2,000 episodes for language-guided
  tasks, including visual and language data. It supports open-vocabulary understanding
  and real-time control. While the license is unspecified, it advances human-robot
  interaction research.
task_description: The robot interacts with various appliances in five different scenes,
  including a kitchen with an oven; a study desk with a bookshelf and lamp; flowers
  and a vase; toy sandwich making; and cloth folding. It opens the microwave and drawers;
  places a book on the shelf; inserts a flower into the vase; and assembles a sandwich.
