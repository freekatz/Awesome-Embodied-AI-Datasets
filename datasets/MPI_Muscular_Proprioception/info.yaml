  introduction: The Proprioceptive Dataset is an open dataset provided by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, containing 25 days of diverse robot motion data. It was released alongside the paper "Proprioception for Precise and Fast Robot Motions" (arXiv:2307.02654) to support research in robot motion control and reinforcement learning. The dataset records proprioceptive data from a four-degree-of-freedom (DoF) tendon-driven robot arm, including joint angles, velocities, and other sensory information, covering various dynamic motion scenarios. The availability of this dataset facilitates the development and testing of advanced robot control algorithms, particularly for tasks requiring precise and high-speed movements.
