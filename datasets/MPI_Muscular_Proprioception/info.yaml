introduction: MPI Muscular Proprioception is a dataset developed by the Max Planck
  Institute for muscular proprioception research. It contains 1,000 episodes of a
  Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with soft materials, including RGB images,
  depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in real-time adaptation
  and human-in-the-loop learning, with a focus on integrating human feedback during
  robot operation. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models,
  enabling comparisons across different pouring and fluid manipulation approaches.
  While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for
  academic use and emphasizes the study of deformable object manipulation.

short_description: MPI Muscular Proprioception is a Franka robot dataset with 1,000
  episodes for soft material tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports real-time
  adaptation and human-in-the-loop learning. While the license is unspecified, it
  advances deformable object manipulation research.
task_description: There is no task that the robot solves. It executes a combination
  of random multisine signals of target pressures, as well as fixed target pressures.
