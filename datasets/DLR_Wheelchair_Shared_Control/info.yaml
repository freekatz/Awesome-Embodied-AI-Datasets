  introduction: DLR Wheelchair Shared Control is a dataset developed by the German
    Aerospace Center (DLR) for human-robot shared control in wheelchair navigation.
    The dataset contains 570 episodes of a wheelchair robot navigating complex environments,
    including RGB images, depth data, and human input commands. It supports research
    in human-intervention guided policy learning and real-time adaptation to dynamic
    environments. The dataset emphasizes the integration of human feedback during
    robot operation, making it a valuable resource for advancing interactive and adaptive
    robotics research. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is
    primarily intended for academic use and is accompanied by evaluation scripts and
    pre-trained models for wheelchair navigation tasks.
