# BC-Z


## Introduction

The BC-Z dataset is a large-scale robotic imitation learning benchmark developed collaboratively by Google, Everyday Robots, UC Berkeley, and Stanford University. It addresses the fundamental challenge of enabling vision-based robotic manipulation systems to generalize to unseen tasks through scalable data-driven learning. Trained on 25,877 diverse manipulation scenarios spanning 100 distinct tasks, BC-Z captures 125 hours of expert demonstrations collected from 12 robots operated by 7 human teleoperators. Its core innovation lies in supporting zero-shot task generalizationâ€”robots can execute novel tasks conditioned solely on high-level task descriptors (e.g., natural language embeddings or human demonstration videos) without task-specific retraining. This capability is enabled by a flexible multi-task policy architecture that learns 7-DoF control strategies adaptable to heterogeneous task representations. By integrating real-world complexity (e.g., object interactions, environmental variations), BC-Z provides a critical foundation for advancing robust and generalizable robotic manipulation. The dataset is publicly available under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license for non-commercial research use.

## Task Description

The robot attempts picking, wiping, and placing tasks on a diverse set of objects on a tabletop, along with a few challenging tasks like stacking cups on top of each other.
