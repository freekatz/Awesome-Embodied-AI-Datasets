  introduction: BC-Z is a robotics dataset developed by Google for zero-shot task
    generalization in imitation learning. It contains over 100,000 episodes of a 7-DOF
    robotic arm performing manipulation tasks, including RGB images, proprioceptive
    states, and natural language instructions. The dataset supports research in language-conditioned
    policy learning and cross-task generalization, with a focus on training models
    to adapt to new tasks without additional demonstrations. While the dataset's license
    is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. BC-Z is accompanied
    by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
    zero-shot imitation learning methods.

short_introduction: BC-Z is a Google dataset with 100k+ episodes for zero-shot manipulation
  tasks, including visual and language data. It supports language-conditioned policy
  learning. While the license is unspecified, it advances cross-task generalization
  research.
task_description: The robot attempts picking, wiping, and placing tasks on a diverse
  set of objects on a tabletop, along with a few challenging tasks like stacking cups
  on top of each other.
