# DROID


## Introduction

DROID is a dataset developed by the DROID project for dynamic robot interaction research. It contains 800 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with dynamic objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in real-time dexterous generative grasp synthesis and visual servo control, with a focus on compensating for external disturbances. It is accompanied by evaluation metrics and simulation environments, making it suitable for studying dynamic object manipulation in robotics. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of visual and proprioceptive data.
