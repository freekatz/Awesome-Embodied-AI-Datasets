  introduction: NYU ROT is a dataset developed by NYU for robot manipulation research,
    focusing on object rearrangement tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a Franka
    Emika Panda robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth
    data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in visual imitation
    learning and goal-driven control, with a focus on generalization to new objects
    and environments. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is
    primarily intended for academic use. NYU ROT includes annotations for object categories
    and manipulation goals, making it suitable for training models to learn task-specific
    skills from visual input. The dataset is accompanied by evaluation scripts and
    pre-trained models, facilitating comparisons across different vision-based robot
    learning methods.

short_introduction: NYU ROT is a Franka robot dataset with 1,000 object rearrangement
  episodes, supporting visual imitation learning. It includes visual and joint data,
  emphasizing generalization. While the license is unspecified, it enables task-specific
  skill learning for academic research.
task_description: The robot arm performs diverse manipulation tasks on a tabletop
  such an box opening, cup stacking, and pouring, among others.
