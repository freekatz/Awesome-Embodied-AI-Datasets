# NYU ROT


## Introduction

NYU ROT is a dataset developed by NYU for robot manipulation research, focusing on object rearrangement tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in visual imitation learning and goal-driven control, with a focus on generalization to new objects and environments. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use. NYU ROT includes annotations for object categories and manipulation goals, making it suitable for training models to learn task-specific skills from visual input. The dataset is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, facilitating comparisons across different vision-based robot learning methods.
