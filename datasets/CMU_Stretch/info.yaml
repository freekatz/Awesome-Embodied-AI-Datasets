introduction: CMU Stretch is a dataset developed by Carnegie Mellon University for
  robot affordance learning. It contains 135 episodes of a Stretch robot performing
  household tasks, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset
  supports research in open-world model-based reinforcement learning and dynamic manipulation,
  with a focus on generalization to unseen objects and environments. It is accompanied
  by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
  vision-based robot learning approaches for affordance prediction tasks. While the
  dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic
  use and emphasizes the integration of visual and proprioceptive data.
