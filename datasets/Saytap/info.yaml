  introduction: Saytap is a dataset developed by the Saytap project for human-robot
    interaction research. It contains 2,000 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot
    performing object manipulation tasks guided by natural language instructions,
    including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports
    research in open-vocabulary language understanding and real-time robot control,
    with a focus on integrating language and vision for task execution. While the
    dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic
    use. Saytap is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling
    comparisons across different human-robot interaction methods.
