  introduction: NYU Franka Play is a dataset developed by NYU for robot learning through
    uncurated play data. It contains 365 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting
    with a toy kitchen setup, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states.
    The dataset supports research in behavior generation and policy learning from
    unstructured, exploratory interactions, with a focus on learning from diverse
    and unlabeled data. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is
    primarily intended for academic use. NYU Franka Play is accompanied by evaluation
    scripts and pre-trained models, facilitating comparisons across different behavior
    cloning and policy learning methods.

short_introduction: NYU Franka Play is a Franka robot dataset with 365 toy kitchen
  episodes, supporting behavior generation from uncurated play. It includes visual
  and joint data. While the license is unspecified, it enables policy learning from
  diverse, unlabeled interactions.
task_description: The robot interacts with a toy kitchen doing arbitrary tasks. It
  opens/closes the microwave door, opens/closes the oven door, turns the stove knobs,
  and moves the pot between the stove and the sink.
