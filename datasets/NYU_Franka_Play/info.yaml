    Play-to-Policy (P2P) is a novel framework for learning robotic manipulation policies through unstructured human "play" data. Unlike traditional task-specific demonstrations, it collects diverse, free-form interactions (e.g., object tossing, stacking, or sliding) from real-world environments. This data trains a goal-conditioned policy via self-supervised learning, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. Key innovations include:

    Scalable data collection: Humans freely interact with objects without predefined tasks, capturing 10x more behavioral diversity than task-centric datasets.

    Automatic goal extraction: Self-generated subgoals from play trajectories bypass manual annotation.

    Real-world deployment: Validated on 10+ manipulation tasks (e.g., "sort colored blocks", "place cup on coaster") with 80%+ success rate on novel instructions.

short_introduction: Play-to-Policy is a robotic learning framework that transforms unstructured human play into goal-conditioned policies, enabling zero-shot generalization for diverse manipulation tasks without task-specific demonstrations.
task_description: The robot interacts with a toy kitchen doing arbitrary tasks. It
  opens/closes the microwave door, opens/closes the oven door, turns the stove knobs,
  and moves the pot between the stove and the sink.
