  introduction: CMU Franka Exploration is a robotics dataset developed by Carnegie
    Mellon University's Human-World Models project, focusing on real-world robot exploration
    and interaction tasks. The dataset contains human-teleoperated trajectories of
    a Franka Emika Panda robot performing object manipulation, exploration, and interaction
    with dynamic environments. It includes RGB images, depth data, joint states, and
    natural language instructions, supporting research in open-world robot learning
    and exploration strategies. The dataset emphasizes learning from unstructured,
    real-world interactions and generalizing to novel scenarios. While the dataset's
    license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic research
    and is accompanied by evaluation frameworks for comparing different exploration
    and control algorithms.
