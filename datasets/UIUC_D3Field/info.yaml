introduction: UIUC D3Field is a dataset developed by the University of Illinois at
  Urbana-Champaign for dynamic 3D descriptor fields in robotic manipulation. It contains
  192 episodes of a UR5 robot performing office desk organization tasks, including
  RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in
  vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning
  from human demonstrations. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained
  models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches
  for tabletop tasks. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is
  primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of 3D scene understanding
  and task planning.
