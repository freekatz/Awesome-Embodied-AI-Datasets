# UIUC D3Field


## Introduction

UIUC D3Field is a dataset developed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for dynamic 3D descriptor fields in robotic manipulation. It contains 192 episodes of a UR5 robot performing office desk organization tasks, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of 3D scene understanding and task planning.
