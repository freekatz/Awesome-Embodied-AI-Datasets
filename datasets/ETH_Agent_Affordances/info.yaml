  introduction: For mobile robots, interacting with articulated objects remains a challenging yet critical task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel closed-loop control pipeline that integrates manipulation priors from affordance estimation with sampling-based whole-body control. We introduce the concept of affordance-aware prompts, which holistically capture an agent’s capabilities and embodiment. Our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches conditioned solely on end-effector geometry. Furthermore, closed-loop affordance reasoning enables the agent to segment tasks into discontinuous motions and recover from failures or unexpected states. Finally, this pipeline achieves high success rates in real-world long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks—specifically, opening (71%) and closing (72%) oven doors.

short_introduction: We propose a closed-loop control pipeline for mobile robots to manipulate articulated objects (e.g., oven doors). By integrating affordance-aware prompts and whole-body control, our method outperforms geometry-only baselines and achieves 71% (opening) and 72% (closing) real-world success rates.
task_description: The robot opens and closes an oven, starting from different initial
  positions and door angles.
