  introduction: ETH Agent Affordances is a dataset developed by ETH Zurich for agent-object
    affordance prediction. It contains 800 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot
    interacting with objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states.
    The dataset supports research in open-world model-based reinforcement learning
    and dynamic manipulation, with a focus on generalization to unseen objects and
    environments. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models,
    enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for
    affordance prediction tasks. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated,
    it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of visual
    and proprioceptive data.

short_introduction: ETH Agent Affordances is a Franka robot dataset with 800 episodes
  for affordance tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports open-world RL
  and dynamic manipulation. While the license is unspecified, it emphasizes generalization
  to unseen objects for academic research.
task_description: The robot opens and closes an oven, starting from different initial
  positions and door angles.
