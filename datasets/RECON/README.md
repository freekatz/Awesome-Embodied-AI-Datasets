# RECON


## Introduction

RECON is a dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for robot-object interaction research. It contains 1,000 episodes of a PR2 robot interacting with household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks. While the dataset's license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the integration of vision and proprioception for object manipulation tasks.
