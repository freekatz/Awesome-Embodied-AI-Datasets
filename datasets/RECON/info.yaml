  introduction: |
    RECON is a novel open-world robotic navigation framework that enables rapid discovery and reliable navigation to user-specified visual goals in unseen environments. Its core innovation lies in integrating latent goal-conditioned models with topological memory graphs, allowing robots to generalize exploration strategies across diverse scenes without pre-built maps. The framework operates in three phases:

    Prior Experience Training:

    Trains a goal-conditioned distance and action prediction model using historical interaction data from previously visited environments.

    Employs step count as a distance proxy and hindsight relabeling to generate supervision signals, learning robust spatial relationships between observations and actions.

    New Environment Exploration:

    Combines frontier-based exploration (identifying unknown regions) with latent goal sampling (predicting high-reward targets via the learned model).

    Continuously fine-tunes the model with real-time interactions to adapt to environmental dynamics (e.g., lighting changes, movable obstacles).

    Navigating Explored Environments:

    Represents the environment as a sparse topological graph G, where nodes are key locations and edges encode traversability costs.

    Plans subgoal paths through G using the fine-tuned model, enabling efficient long-horizon navigation to user-defined targets (e.g., "find a red chair") with 92% success rate in cluttered indoor scenes.
