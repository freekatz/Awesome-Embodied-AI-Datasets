  introduction: RECON is a dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for robot-object
    interaction research. It contains 1,000 episodes of a PR2 robot interacting with
    household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The
    dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object
    manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is accompanied
    by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
    vision-based robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks. While the dataset's
    license is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and
    emphasizes the integration of vision and proprioception for object manipulation
    tasks.
