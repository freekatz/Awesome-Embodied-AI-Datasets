    TACO (Tool-Object Interaction with Dual-Hand Cooperation) is a large-scale real-world dataset capturing bimanual manipulation of tools and objects in daily activities. It provides 5.2 million RGB images from 12 third-person views and 1 egocentric view, covering 2,500 interaction sequences, 196 object meshes, and 131 distinct <tool, action, target object> triads (e.g., <spatula, stir, pot>). The dataset includes precise 4D annotations: hand-object mesh sequences, 2D segmentation masks, and marker-free images generated via an automated pipeline combining motion capture optimization and inpainting models. Designed for generalizable manipulation research, TACO introduces three benchmarks—Action Recognition, Motion Prediction, and Collaborative Grasp Synthesis—with specialized splits (S1-S4) to evaluate cross-category, geometric, and triad-compositional generalization. Experiments reveal significant gaps in state-of-the-art methods; for example, action recognition accuracy drops by 25% on unseen triads (S3 split), highlighting critical challenges in real-world deployment.

short_introduction: TACO is a real-world dataset for bimanual tool-object interaction, featuring 5.2M images, 131 
  interaction triads, and 4D annotations. It benchmarks generalization in action recognition, motion prediction, and grasp synthesis, exposing limitations of current methods.
