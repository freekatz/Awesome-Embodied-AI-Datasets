introduction: Freiburg Franka Play is a robotic manipulation dataset hosted on Kaggle,
  focusing on teleoperated interactions with a Franka Emika Panda robot. The dataset
  contains 1,085 episodes of pick-and-place tasks in simulated environments, including
  RGB images, joint positions, and Cartesian coordinates. It is designed to support
  research in robot learning, particularly in vision-based control and task generalization.
  The dataset is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal license, dedicating it to the
  public domain. It includes annotations for natural language instructions and object
  states, making it suitable for training models conditioned on language or visual
  goals. The Freiburg Franka Play dataset is a lightweight resource for academic research,
  enabling quick prototyping and experimentation in robotic manipulation tasks.

short_description: Freiburg Franka Play is a Kaggle-hosted dataset with 1,085 teleoperated
  Franka robot episodes. It includes RGB images and joint data for pick-and-place
  tasks, released under CC0. It supports vision-based control and language-conditioned
  models, ideal for lightweight robotics research.
task_description: '"The robot interacts with toy blocks, it pick and places them,
  stacks them, unstacks them, opens drawers, sliding doors and turrns on LED lights
  by pushing buttons."'
