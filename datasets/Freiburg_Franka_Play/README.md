# Freiburg Franka Play


## Introduction

Freiburg Franka Play is a robotic manipulation dataset hosted on Kaggle, focusing on teleoperated interactions with a Franka Emika Panda robot. The dataset contains 1,085 episodes of pick-and-place tasks in simulated environments, including RGB images, joint positions, and Cartesian coordinates. It is designed to support research in robot learning, particularly in vision-based control and task generalization. The dataset is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal license, dedicating it to the public domain. It includes annotations for natural language instructions and object states, making it suitable for training models conditioned on language or visual goals. The Freiburg Franka Play dataset is a lightweight resource for academic research, enabling quick prototyping and experimentation in robotic manipulation tasks.
