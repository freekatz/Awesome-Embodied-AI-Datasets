  introduction:
Play-Fusion introduces a pioneering framework for learning goal-directed robotic skills from unstructured, uncurated play data, which is rich yet challenging due to its inherent multimodality, noise, and suboptimal behaviors, addressing these challenges by leveraging diffusion model advancements to extract multi-task robotic policies with two key innovations: Conditional Denoising Diffusion, which models robot state and action spaces via a diffusion process that iteratively refines noisy trajectories into coherent behaviors, handling play data complexity by generating diverse and temporally consistent actions that outperform traditional Gaussian policies in capturing multi-modal distributions, and a Discrete Skill Bottleneck that introduces a discrete latent bottleneck during conditional behavior generation to incentivize agents to abstract a reusable skill vocabulary from language-annotated play data, enabling interpretable skill transfer to novel tasks without additional supervision; validated across simulated and real-world environments like deformable object manipulation and multi-step assembly, Play-Fusion achieves over 40% higher success rates in long-horizon tasks compared to imitation learning baselines, demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen objects through skill recombination, and reduces human curation effort by 90% by directly learning from noisy play data, bridging unstructured play with structured skill acquisition to advance scalable robot learning in the wild.

short_introduction: Play-Fusion learns robotic skills from unstructured play data via diffusion models and a discrete skill bottleneck, enabling interpretable and generalizable behavior synthesis across diverse tasks.
task_description: 'The robot plays with 3 complex scenes: a grill with many cooking
  objects like toaster, pan, etc. It has to pick, open, place, close. It has to set
  a table, move plates, cups, utensils. And it has to place dishes in the sink, dishwasher,
  hand cups etc.'
