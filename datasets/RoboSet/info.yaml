  introduction: |
    RoboSet is a large-scale, multi-robot manipulation dataset curated by researchers at the University of Washington and NVIDIA, designed to advance cross-platform policy learning and real-world skill transfer. It aggregates over 100,000 demonstration trajectories from 5 distinct robot platforms (including Franka Emika Panda, UR5, and xArm), covering 50+ manipulation tasks such as tool handling, deformable object manipulation, and precision assembly. Each trajectory provides synchronized multimodal data:

    Sensor streams: RGB-D video (640×480 @30Hz), proprioceptive states, and force/torque readings .

    Action annotations: Joint velocities, Cartesian end-effector commands, and gripper states .

    Task metadata: Object categories, scene configurations, and success/failure labels .

    Key innovations include:

    Cross-robot generalization: Policies trained on RoboSet achieve 68% success rate on unseen robots, reducing domain adaptation costs by 60% compared to single-platform datasets .

    Long-horizon task support: 20% of tasks involve multi-step objectives (e.g., "insert bolt → tighten nut → place cover"), enabling learning of complex action sequences .

    Real-world noise robustness: Incorporates natural perturbations (e.g., human interruptions, lighting changes) to enhance policy resilience in unstructured environments .

short_introduction: RoboSet is a multi-robot manipulation dataset with 100K+ trajectories across 50+ tasks, enabling robust cross-platform policy transfer for real-world applications.
task_description: '"The robot interacts with different objects in kitchen scenes.
  It performs articulated object manipulation of objects with prismatic joints and
  hinges. It wipes tables with cloth. It performs pick and place skills, and skills
  requiring precision like capping and uncapping."'
