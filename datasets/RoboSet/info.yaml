introduction: RoboSet is a dataset developed by the RoboSet project for robot-object
  interaction research. It contains 1,000 episodes of a PR2 robot interacting with
  household objects, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The
  dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation,
  with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is accompanied by evaluation
  scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based
  robot learning approaches for tabletop tasks. While the dataset's license is not
  explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes the
  integration of vision and proprioception for object manipulation tasks.

short_description: RoboSet is a PR2 robot dataset with 1,000 episodes for household
  tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports imitation learning and multi-object
  manipulation. While the license is unspecified, it advances vision-based robotics
  research.
task_description: '"The robot interacts with different objects in kitchen scenes.
  It performs articulated object manipulation of objects with prismatic joints and
  hinges. It wipes tables with cloth. It performs pick and place skills, and skills
  requiring precision like capping and uncapping."'
