# UTokyo xArm Bimanual


## Introduction

UTokyo xArm Bimanual is a robotics dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for bimanual manipulation tasks. It contains 1,500 episodes of a xArm robot performing towel folding and other household tasks, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based imitation learning and multi-object manipulation, with a focus on learning from human demonstrations. It is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. UTokyo xArm Bimanual is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for bimanual tasks.
