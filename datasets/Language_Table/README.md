# Language Table


## Introduction

Language-Table is a large-scale dataset collected by Google Research in 2022 to advance real-time human-robot interaction through natural language instructions. It contains nearly 600,000 language-annotated trajectories generated via teleoperation, enabling robots to learn open-vocabulary visuomotor control policies. By training on this dataset, robots can execute 10x more diverse instructions than prior methods, covering complex real-world tasks such as object manipulation and spatial reasoning. The dataset supports multi-task continual learning and serves as a benchmark for evaluating interactive language grounding in dynamic environments. Associated research (e.g., "Interactive Language: Talking to Robots in Real Time") demonstrates its role in bridging semantic commands with low-level robotic actions, pushing the frontier of embodied AI.
