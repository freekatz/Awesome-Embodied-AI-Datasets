# Language Table


## Introduction

Language Table is a large-scale dataset developed by Google Research for open-vocabulary visuolinguomotor learning. It consists of 442,226 real robot episodes and 181,020 simulation episodes, covering tasks like block stacking and object rearrangement with natural language instructions. The dataset includes RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states, enabling the training of models that can interpret and execute complex language commands in dynamic environments. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing free use and modification for research and development. Language Table is designed to push the boundaries of robot learning by integrating language understanding with continuous control, supporting the development of interactive, real-time natural language-instructable robots.
