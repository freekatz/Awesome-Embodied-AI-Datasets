# Berkeley Fanuc Manipulation


## Introduction

The FANUC Manipulation Dataset is a comprehensive vision-based robotic learning resource collected via a FANUC Mate 200iD robot, integrating multi-view visual data (third-person fixed and egocentric wrist-mounted 224Ã—224 RGB videos), robot trajectory data (joint positions, gripper states, velocities, and Cartesian-space actions), and language task instructions (natural language commands for conditioning manipulation tasks), designed to advance imitation learning and vision-motor policy training by enabling visuomotor policy development (training closed-loop control models from visual inputs to actions), visual representation fine-tuning (adapting pre-trained models like ResNet and ViT to robotic domains), and instruction-conditioned generation (learning policies mapping language commands to robot behaviors), with a structured format supporting seamless integration with modern frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow to facilitate cross-modal learning and sim-to-real transfer research.

## Task Description

A Fanuc robot performs various manipulation tasks. For example, it opens drawers, picks up objects, closes doors, closes computers, and pushes objects to desired locations.
