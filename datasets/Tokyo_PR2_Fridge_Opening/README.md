# Tokyo PR2 Fridge Opening


## Introduction

Tokyo PR2 Fridge Opening is a dataset developed by the University of Tokyo for refrigerator door opening tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a PR2 robot interacting with refrigerators, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. The dataset supports research in vision-based manipulation and real-world task planning, with a focus on object affordance prediction and dynamic control. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing free use and modification for academic and commercial purposes. Tokyo PR2 Fridge Opening is accompanied by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different vision-based robot learning approaches for complex manipulation tasks.
