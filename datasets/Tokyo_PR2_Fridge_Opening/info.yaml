  introduction: |
    RLDS Dataset Builder is an open-source toolkit designed to streamline the creation of standardized datasets for robotic manipulation tasks within the Reinforcement Learning Datasets (RLDS) ecosystem. It enables researchers to record, annotate, and share interaction trajectories in a format preserving temporal integrity—critical for tasks like "PR2 opening a refrigerator door," where sequential actions (e.g., grasp handle → pull → stabilize) must maintain step-by-step continuity. Key features include:

    Lossless Temporal Logging:

    Captures synchronized observations (RGB-D images), actions (joint torques), rewards, and terminal states in nested step-episode structures, preventing fragmentation common in ad-hoc datasets .

    Custom Metadata Support:

    Annotates trajectories with task-specific tags (e.g., object_affordance: "handle_graspable") and environmental context (e.g., fridge_mass: 42kg), enabling fine-grained analysis for imitation learning .

    Seamless TFDS Integration:

    Exports datasets directly to TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) with auto-generated metadata cards, allowing global access via tfds.load('pr2_fridge_demo') .

    Validated on 7 real-world tasks (e.g., door opening, drawer retrieval), datasets built with this tool reduce policy training time by 35% compared to fragmented formats and support zero-shot transfer across robot platforms (e.g., PR2 → Franka Emika) .
