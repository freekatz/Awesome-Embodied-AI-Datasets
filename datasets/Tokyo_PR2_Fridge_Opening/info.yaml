introduction: Tokyo PR2 Fridge Opening is a dataset developed by the University of
  Tokyo for refrigerator door opening tasks. It contains 1,000 episodes of a PR2 robot
  interacting with refrigerators, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint
  states. The dataset supports research in vision-based manipulation and real-world
  task planning, with a focus on object affordance prediction and dynamic control.
  It is released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing free use and modification
  for academic and commercial purposes. Tokyo PR2 Fridge Opening is accompanied by
  evaluation scripts and pre-trained models, enabling comparisons across different
  vision-based robot learning approaches for complex manipulation tasks.
