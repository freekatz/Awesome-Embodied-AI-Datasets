  introduction: DLR Sara Grid Clamp Dataset is a robotics dataset developed by the
    German Aerospace Center (DLR) for grid clamp manipulation tasks. The dataset contains
    real-world trajectories of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting with grid clamps,
    including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states. It supports research
    in dynamic object manipulation and real-time adaptation, with a focus on integrating
    human feedback during robot operation. The dataset emphasizes the study of fluid
    dynamics and pouring tasks in unstructured environments. While the dataset's license
    is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and is accompanied
    by evaluation scripts and pre-trained models for pouring and fluid manipulation
    research.

short_introduction: DLR Sara Grid Clamp Dataset is a DLR dataset with Franka robot
  episodes for grid clamp tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports dynamic
  manipulation and real-time adaptation research. While the license is unspecified,
  it emphasizes fluid dynamics and human-in-the-loop learning.
task_description: The robot learns to place the grid clamp in the grids on the table.
