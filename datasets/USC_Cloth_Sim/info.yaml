introduction: USC Cloth Sim is a dataset developed by USC's RESL Lab for deformable
  object manipulation research. It contains 800 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot
  interacting with cloth materials, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint
  states. The dataset supports research in cloth folding, smoothing, and dynamic manipulation,
  with a focus on learning from expert demonstrations. It is released under the Creative
  Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, allowing free use and
  modification for academic and commercial purposes. USC Cloth Sim is accompanied
  by evaluation metrics and simulation environments, making it suitable for studying
  deformable object manipulation in robotics.
