  introduction: |
    DMFD (Dynamic Manipulation of Fluid Dynamics) is a pioneering dataset developed by the University of Southern California's Robotic Embedded Systems Lab, designed to advance robotic manipulation of deformable fluids (e.g., water, oil, viscous solutions) in real-world scenarios. It addresses the critical challenge of modeling fluid dynamics under robotic interactions—traditionally hindered by complex viscosity changes, splashing effects, and non-Newtonian behaviors—through large-scale, high-fidelity data collection. Key features include:

    Multimodal Fluid Interaction Capture:

    Records 1,000+ real-world trials of fluid manipulation tasks (pouring, mixing, stirring) with synchronized:

    High-speed imaging (120 fps RGB-D) for splash dynamics tracking

    6-DoF force-torque sensing (1000 Hz) for viscosity measurement

    Particle tracer flows for 3D fluid reconstruction

    Environmental perturbations (e.g., container shaking, airflow interference)

    Fluid State Estimation:

    Trains neural operators to predict fluid properties (viscosity, surface tension) and future states (e.g., "splash risk level") from partial observations, achieving 92% accuracy in spill prevention during robotic pouring tasks .

    Sim2Real Transfer Framework:

    Provides PyBullet Fluid Simulator with domain randomization calibrated to DMFD data, reducing real-world policy training costs by 85% while maintaining 88% task success across 10 fluid types .

    Validated on tasks like "precision pouring to 50ml mark" and "emulsion stabilization," DMFD enables robust fluid manipulation in industrial and household settings, outperforming prior model-based methods by 40% in accuracy .
