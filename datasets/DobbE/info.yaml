    Dobb-E: On Bringing Robots Home is an open-source framework designed to enable rapid learning of household manipulation tasks via data-driven imitation learning, addressing the critical challenges of scarce real-world training data and complexity in adapting to diverse domestic environments through two key components: The Stick, a low-cost hardware tool using iPhone sensors and 3D-printed parts to collect human demonstrations in real homes, capturing multimodal data (RGB-D, motion, depth) at 100 Hz for high-fidelity task recording without specialized equipment, and Home Pretrained Representations (HPR), a visual foundation model trained on 13 hours of data from 22 New York City homes that generalizes across environments by encoding household-specific features (e.g., lighting variations, clutter) to reduce task-specific retraining; in deployment, Dobb-E learns new tasks in 20 minutes (5 minutes of user demonstration with The Stick and 15 minutes of model fine-tuning to adapt HPR to the target environment), validated across 10 homes and 109 tasks (e.g., opening air fryers, arranging cushions) with an 81% success rate in unseen home settings—outperforming lab-trained baselines by >40%—and robustness to real-world challenges like strong shadows and novice-user demonstration variability.

short_introduction: Dobb-E enables robots to learn household tasks in 20 minutes via user demonstrations and adaptive
  pretrained representations (HPR). Validated in 109 real-home tasks with 81% success, it open-sources data, models, and hardware designs to democratize home robotics.
task_description: The demo collector uses the Stick to collect data from 7 tasks,
  including door/drawer opening/closing, handle grasping, pick and place, and random
  play data.
