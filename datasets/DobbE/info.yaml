introduction: DobbE is a dataset developed by the DobbE project for dynamic object
  bin picking tasks. It contains 800 episodes of a Franka Emika Panda robot interacting
  with objects in bins, including RGB images, depth data, and robot joint states.
  The dataset supports research in real-time dexterous generative grasp synthesis
  and visual servo control, with a focus on compensating for external disturbances.
  It is accompanied by evaluation metrics and simulation environments, making it suitable
  for studying dynamic object manipulation in robotics. While the dataset's license
  is not explicitly stated, it is primarily intended for academic use and emphasizes
  the integration of visual and proprioceptive data.

short_description: DobbE is a Franka robot dataset with 800 episodes for bin picking
  tasks, including visual and joint data. It supports real-time grasp synthesis and
  visual servo control. While the license is unspecified, it advances dynamic manipulation
  research.
task_description: The demo collector uses the Stick to collect data from 7 tasks,
  including door/drawer opening/closing, handle grasping, pick and place, and random
  play data.
